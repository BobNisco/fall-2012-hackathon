## Marist College Fall 2012 Hackathon
### By Bob Nisco and Jason Parraga

## The Challenge
======
- Create an application that will enhance the lives of Marist students

## Inspiration
======
- As previous Marist College ResNet employees, there was nothing worse than working with an outdated system used to manage CSRs.
- Customers also had no way of telling what the current status is of their report unless they called the office which is both time consuming and can be easily automated.

## What We Made
======
- A system for both students and ResNet employees to track CSRs/reports.
- Front-end facing system for students to check to-the-second updates on the status of their report, check if ResNet is open and if it's a good time to show up for a speedy fix.
- Back-end facing system for ResNet employees to manage all reports (open or closed), give status updates to the user, and search the backlog of all reports.
